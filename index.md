# Introduction

Edurata is BI-Platform enabling users to run `node.js`, `python` and `bash` code in a modular way in the cloud without having to learn Devops.

### You don't need to care about:

- Cloud Providers (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc..)
- Orchestration (Docker & Kubernetes)
- Scaling
- Availability
- Interfaces & Apis
  |

### Use cases:

- CI/CD pipeline
- BI Ingest pipelines
- Cron Jobs
- API Backend

### Resources

There is two main resources in this app, [Workflows](https://docs.edurata.com/pages/workflows.html) and [Functions](https://docs.edurata.com/pages/workflows.html).

While **Functions define how** functionality is executed and what information they consume and expose, **Workflows define in which order** Functions are executed and how information flows between them.
