# Introduction

Edurata is BI-Platform enabling users to run `node.js`, `python` or docker containers in a modular way in the cloud without having to care about Devops.

### You don't need to care about:

- Cloud Providers (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc..)
- Orchestration (Docker & Kubernetes)
- Scaling
- Availability
- CI/CD

### Use cases:

- CI/CD pipeline
- BI pipelines
- Cron Jobs

### Resources

There is two main resources in this app, [Workflows](https://docs.edurata.com/pages/workflows.html) and [Functions](https://docs.edurata.com/pages/workflows.html).

While **Functions define how** functionality is executed and what information they consume and expose, **Workflows define in which order** Functions are executed and how information flows between them.

Learn more about [Functions](pages/functions/index.md) and
[Workflows](pages/workflows/index.md)
