# Metering

In order to run any workflow in a [deployment](../deployments/index.md) or use storage (for artefacts or function code) so-called `execution units` or short exec units need to be available which act as the "currency" in which processes on the `Edurata workflows` platform are measured.

The "exchange rate" of `execution units` are the following:

1 unit = `1000 minutes` runner time = `10 GB` new used storage = `~10 $` (exact price depends on your plan and amount).
